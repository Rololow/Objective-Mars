## History

Flint was a crucial material in the Stone Age, used primarily for making tools and weapons. It’s a type of hard, fine-grained rock that can be easily chipped into sharp edges when struck. Early humans would strike flint against other hard stones to create tools like knives, scrapers, and spearheads. These tools helped with tasks such as hunting, skinning animals, and cutting plants.

Flint's ability to produce sharp edges made it invaluable for early human survival, and it was often found in specific areas where it naturally occurred. Flint tools played a key role in the transition from the Paleolithic to the Neolithic period, marking advancements in human technology and craftsmanship.
