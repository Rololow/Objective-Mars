## History

A bloomery is an ancient furnace used to smelt iron from its ore, typically using charcoal as fuel. Unlike modern blast furnaces, which melt iron completely, bloomeries only heat the iron enough to separate it from impurities, producing a spongy mass called a "bloom." The bloom would then be hammered to remove slag and shape the iron.

The first bloomeries appeared around 1200 BCE to 500 BCE, and they were key in the Iron Age, enabling societies to create tools and weapons from iron. These furnaces were typically made of clay or stone and relied on airflow to maintain high temperatures. Bloomeries were used for centuries, especially before the development of larger blast furnaces, and their design spread across regions like Europe, Africa, and the Near East.
